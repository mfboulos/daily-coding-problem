### Solution Procedure
For each problem, I have the following procedure:

1. Create a `feature` branch for the problem
2. Commit the new directory with a README outlining the following:
    - The name of the problem
    - Relevant problem specs
    - Language and version
    - Start time
3. Actually do the problem, committing iteratively
4. Once I feel confident about it, update the README with:
    - End time
    - Runtime complexity progression
    - Afterthoughts
5. Merge the feature branch to `master`
6. Update the index to reference the newly completed problem

A template for each problem's meta info can be found [here](template.md).
